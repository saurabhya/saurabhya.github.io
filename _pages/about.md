I am currently working on Complex-valued Neural Networks in computer vision under the supervision of <a href='https://sites.google.com/site/koteswarraojerripothula/home?authuser=0'>Dr. Koteswar Rao Jerripothula.</a>. Prior to this I completed my Masters and Bachelors from <a href='#'>University of Delhi</a>.

When I am not working on my thesis, I usually spend time exploring different keyboards on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ErgoMechKeyboards/) or try to convince people why they should use vim.
I also like to take part in nearby running events and can be seen running around campus in the evenings.
