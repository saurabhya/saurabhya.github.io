This is a repo for my personal website.
I haven't worked on this since 2020. During that time I had lot of time on my hands and I would sit and
try to add new features and play around with CSS.

The original idea of this site was taken from [Sandeeplearning.com](http://www.sandeeplearning.com) which itself had taken idea from [digika.pl](https://digika.pl).

I took the original idea and tried to make it as unique as possible. However, there are lots of things that I still need to improve. Recently, I had decided that instead of spending time in youtube, I would sit and work on regaining my CSS skills.

Some things I need to add to this site are:
- [ ] Add blog page
- [ ] Add links to pages
- [ ] Sort stuff into separate tabbed page

Earlier, I had also thought of making this site as a vim emulation but I haven't had the chance to make it possible. I might add this in future.
